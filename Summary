In the United States, lifestyle diseases have reached a critical point and have become the cause for the majority of the deaths. Lifestyle diseases include diabetes and ischemic diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Healthcare costs associated with lifestyle diseases have also become a severe burden on the economy. Non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring systems (NICGMs) represent a promising solution to the rising epidemic of lifestyle diseases. These systems are used to monitor extrapolated blood sugar levels on a real-time basis in a similar manner to personal heart-rate monitors or activity trackers. These systems do not require blood samples or expert medical assistance to measure sugar levels and as a result, can be incorporated into the lives of many people. The findings of this study show that NICGMs have a significant impact in reducing the blood sugar levels among the participants. The blood sugar level improvement is also seen on a statistically significant portion of the sample size. The findings are very positive for the stakeholders of the healthcare industry and should at least prompt additional studies with larger scopes to further establish the efficacy of NICGMs
